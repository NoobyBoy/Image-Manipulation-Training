# Image Manipulation Training

A repository where I push my little function I do with the Library Pillow (Fork of lib PIL) to make visual effect on pictures. Do not hesitate to read the code and tell me if you see bad things or things improvable (It's the point of this repo).

## ✔️ Function Done ✔️

    black_and_white : Black and white effect
   
    sepia : Sepia effect with the red amout given
 
    luminosity_variation : increase/decrease luminosity
    luminosity_percentage : Change luminosity in depending on a percentage
  
    negative : negative effect

    thresholding :  Thresholding effect with the given threshold

    pixelisation : Pixelise the picture with the size of pixel you want

## 〰️ Function Done but the result is not satisfying 〰️

### Do not hesitate to let me know how to improve these ^^
